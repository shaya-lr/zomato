# zomato-data-Analysis

This project performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Zomato dataset to gain insights into restaurant trends, customer preferences, and other important metrics. The analysis is done using **Google Colab** to leverage its cloud environment for data processing.

### Dataset Overview:
The dataset contains information about restaurants listed on Zomato, including:
- **Restaurant name, location, and type**
- **Cuisine types**
- **Average cost for two people**
- **Customer ratings**
- **Number of votes**
- **City and country details**

### Objective:
The goal of this project is to analyze the Zomato dataset and extract meaningful insights regarding:
- The distribution of restaurant ratings
- Popular cuisines and restaurant types
- Geographical distribution of restaurants by city and country
- Correlation between cost, ratings, and number of votes

### Steps Involved:
1. **Data Loading**:
   The dataset is loaded into a Pandas DataFrame using Google Colab. You can either upload the file directly or access it via Google Drive.

2. **Data Cleaning**:
   Missing values, duplicate entries, and irrelevant data are cleaned or removed for smooth analysis.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Visualize the distribution of restaurant ratings.
   - Identify the most common cuisines and restaurant types.
   - Analyze the average cost for two people across different cities and countries.
   - Explore correlations between ratings, number of votes, and cost.
   
4. **Visualization**:
   Data visualizations are created using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** to help identify patterns and trends.

### Technologies Used:
- **Google Colab**: A cloud-based Jupyter Notebook environment for running Python code.
- **Python Libraries**:
  - `Pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis.
  - `Matplotlib` and `Seaborn`: For data visualization.
  - `NumPy`: For numerical operations.

### How to Run the Project:
1. Upload the Zomato dataset or link it through Google Drive.
2. Run the Jupyter notebook in Google Colab.
3. Execute the cells for data loading, cleaning, analysis, and visualization.

### Insights:
- Popular cuisines based on customer preferences.
- Relationship between cost and ratings.
- Distribution of restaurants by city and country.
- Key factors contributing to higher ratings.

### Conclusion:
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of restaurant data from Zomato. It helps understand market trends, customer preferences, and factors affecting restaurant success.
